# RonaTutoring Website
Rona Tutoring was a project that offered free tutoring to students in need during the COVID-19 pandemic. The system comprised of a website with a HTML form which sent responses to a Discord bot. Tutors would then "react" on Discord and the bot would assign a student to them. Over time, this allowed our of tutors to teach hundreds of students. The project was completed after California reopened and educational resources were fully available.
